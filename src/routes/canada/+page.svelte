<h1 class="text-3xl">I am a proud canadian!</h1>
<p>
    I was born in the united states and moved to canada with my family when I was less than two years old. I became a naturalized canadian when my parents
    became citizens. given the current global geopolitical situation, I am proud to call myself a canadian and align my allegiance with canada
