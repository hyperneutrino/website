            <a href="https://daedalusbot.xyz/" target="_blank">Daedalus</a> &mdash; Daedalus is a general-purpose public Discord bot. This website is the
            dashboard for it, which includes documentation and settings configuration. You can view a showcase of its features
            <a href="/portfolio/daedalus">here</a>. The tech stack is listed at the bottom of the
            <a href="https://daedalusbot.xyz/docs/introduction" target="_blank">documentation introduction page</a>.

            <a href="https://teyvatcollective.network" target="_blank">Teyvat Collective Network</a> &mdash; The TCN is a collaboration between several Discord
            servers in a video game subcommunity. I designed and implemented this website to serve as documentation, configuration, etc. You can view a showcase
            of its features
            <a href="/portfolio/tcn">here</a>. The tech stack (on the web develpment side) is Node.JS, PNPM, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, MySQL, tRPC, and React.

            Mitchell with which I had nothing to do. I created a website to help people learn and improve at Jelly, provide tools and resources for optimizing code
            length in Jelly, and test Jelly code using Dennis' Try-It-Online's API.
