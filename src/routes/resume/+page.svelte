<p>Here are some of the projects of which I'm the most proud! You can find an (incomplete) list of things I've made on my GitHub.</p>

    </span>
    <p>
        <b>Daedalus</b> is a general-purpose Discord bot that I made after being dissatisfied with other established bots in the space. I wanted something that offered
        more configurable features, and so I initially built a custom bot for a server. As people became more familiar with the bot, several other servers wanted
        to use the same it, and so eventually I made it a public bot with even more features and even more customizability.

        I've been competing in the <b>Advent of Code</b> for many years with consistently high leaderboard rankings. I think the Advent of Code is a great opportunity
        to develop and refine your coding skills, no matter your level of experience.

        I've been creating solution videos on my
        <a href="https://youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>, which I hope can inspire others to challenge themselves and develop
        their skills.

        The <b>Teyvat Collective Network</b> is a network Discord servers in the community of Genshin Impact (a video game). I was an admin of this community and
        organized much of the internal operations, community management, and public relations. I also owned and maintained the technical infrastructure, including
        an internal and an external Discord bot, a website, and an API.

    <p>
        <b>Proton</b> is a multi-paradigm programming language inspired by Python's simplicity with C-like syntax and functional features. It is not a production-ready
        language and is not too stable, but I made this in high school well before I later learned parser and compiler design and programming language theory in
        university.
